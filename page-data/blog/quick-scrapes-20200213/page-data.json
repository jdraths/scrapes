The 737 Max, a redesign of an older aircraft, is a microcosm of the issues this caused: \"Writing in the engineering industry publication IEEE Spectrum, pilot and software developer Gregory Travis explains how these repeat redesigns have led to recent tragedies. The plane was designed for a time before machine-aided cargo loading and so sits low to the ground to aid ground crews hauling baggage. But as the planes grew larger, so too have their engines. Instead of being hung under the wing, as in earlier models, the engines have been moved forward and upward, potentially leading to an aerodynamic stall under certain circumstances. 'Instead of going back to the drawing board and getting the airframe hardware right, Boeing relied on something called the ‘Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System,’ or MCAS,' he writes. \"</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Today's Quick Scrapes"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/quick-scrapes-20200213/"}}}
