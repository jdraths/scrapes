We run that command so often the saved keystrokes probably save a significant amount of time each year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/14489111/2628223\">Here's how we do it in 2020</a>. Simply add an alias to <code>~/.gitconfig</code> like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">[alias]\n    co = checkout\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the process we also found <a href=\"https://jonsuh.com/blog/git-command-line-shortcuts/\">a neat tutorial for all kinds of aliases</a> that you could set up in <code>~/.bashrc</code> or <code>~/.zshrc</code>. We added:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">alias gaa='git add .'\nalias gcm='git commit --message'\n</code></pre>\n<p>... since those are our two most common commands. We didn't add any other aliases since we don't like adding complexity to rarely used tasks.</p>\n<p>Also, as one last pro-tip <a href=\"https://medium.com/@rajsek/zsh-bash-startup-files-loading-order-bashrc-zshrc-etc-e30045652f2e\">here is a great post on zshrc / bashrc, etc. loading orders</a>. This is useful if you've ever found your changes don't seem to work... and remember:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">source ~/.zshrc\n</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to Alias Git Checkout to Git Co and other Commands"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/aliasing-git-checkout-and-other-bash-commands/"}}}
