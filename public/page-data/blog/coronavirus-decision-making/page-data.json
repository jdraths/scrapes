As the coronavirus pandemic takes hold, we are making decisions without reliable data</a></p>\n<p>Some questions we don't have the answer to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the real rate of infection?</li>\n<li>How many people in the US have already been infected?</li>\n<li>How many of those people are asymptomatic?</li>\n<li>How many hospitalizations per day?</li>\n<li>What is the real mortality rate?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Without the answers to these questions we have no idea whether we need to shutdown our economies or whether we are far past that point:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Draconian countermeasures have been adopted in many countries. If the pandemic dissipates — either on its own or because of these measures — short-term extreme social distancing and lockdowns may be bearable. How long, though, should measures like these be continued if the pandemic churns across the globe unabated? How can policymakers tell if they are doing more good than harm?</p>\n<p>Vaccines or affordable treatments take many months (or even years) to develop and test properly. Given such timelines, the consequences of long-term lockdowns are entirely unknown.</p>\n<p>Given the limited testing to date, some deaths and probably the vast majority of infections due to SARS-CoV-2 are being missed. We don’t know if we are failing to capture infections by a factor of three or 300. </p>\n<p>This evidence fiasco creates tremendous uncertainty about the risk of dying from Covid-19. Reported case fatality rates, like the official 3.4% rate from the World Health Organization, cause horror — and are meaningless. Patients who have been tested for SARS-CoV-2 are disproportionately those with severe symptoms and bad outcomes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The only case where we have tested <strong>all</strong> people in a population is the Diamond Princess cruise ship. There were 7 deaths in 700 infections:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The case fatality rate there was 1.0%, but this was a largely elderly population, in which the death rate from Covid-19 is much higher.</p>\n<p>Projecting the Diamond Princess mortality rate onto the age structure of the U.S. population, the death rate among people infected with Covid-19 would be 0.125%. But since this estimate is based on extremely thin data — there were just seven deaths among the 700 infected passengers and crew — the real death rate could stretch from five times lower (0.025%) to five times higher (0.625%). It is also possible that some of the passengers who were infected might die later, and that tourists may have different frequencies of chronic diseases — a risk factor for worse outcomes with SARS-CoV-2 infection — than the general population. Adding these extra sources of uncertainty, reasonable estimates for the case fatality ratio in the general U.S. population vary from 0.05% to 1%.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p><strong>A population-wide case fatality rate of 0.05% is lower than seasonal influenza.</strong> If that is the true rate, locking down the world with potentially tremendous social and financial consequences may be totally irrational. It’s like an elephant being attacked by a house cat. Frustrated and trying to avoid the cat, the elephant accidentally jumps off a cliff and dies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In theory flattening the curve could actually be <strong>worse</strong> than the alternative:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flattening the curve to avoid overwhelming the health system is conceptually sound — in theory. A visual that has become viral in media and social media shows how flattening the curve reduces the volume of the epidemic that is above the threshold of what the health system can handle at any moment.</p>\n<p>Yet if the health system does become overwhelmed, the majority of the extra deaths may not be due to coronavirus but to other common diseases and conditions such as heart attacks, strokes, trauma, bleeding, and the like that are not adequately treated. If the level of the epidemic does overwhelm the health system and extreme measures have only modest effectiveness, then flattening the curve may make things worse: Instead of being overwhelmed during a short, acute phase, the health system will remain overwhelmed for a more protracted period.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We have no idea whether we are causing more harm than good:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the most pessimistic scenario, which I do not espouse, if the new coronavirus infects 60% of the global population and 1% of the infected people die, that will translate into more than 40 million deaths globally, matching the 1918 influenza pandemic.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of this hecatomb would be people with limited life expectancies. That’s in contrast to 1918, when many young people died.</p>\n<p>One can only hope that, much like in 1918, life will continue. Conversely, with lockdowns of months, if not years, life largely stops, short-term and long-term consequences are entirely unknown, and billions, not just millions, of lives may be eventually at stake.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"We are making improper Coronavirus decisions with incomplete data"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/coronavirus-decision-making/"}}}
