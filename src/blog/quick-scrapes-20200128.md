# All things productivity today:

[Marc Andreesen's Guide to Productivity](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_personal_productivity.html) "Don't keep a schedule... Always work on whatever is most important or most interesting."

[Daniel Gross on Productivity](https://dcgross.com/improvising-for-productivity/) "Time isn’t the correct index for a schedule. Time doesn't know when I'll be in flow... When I mis-fire and schedule a meeting for when I’m in flow, it can cost me double the meeting time. Breaking the feedback loop of flow with a meeting, notification, or anything else should be illegal. And time-based scheduling often causes it."
