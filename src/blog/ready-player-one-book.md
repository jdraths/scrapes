Plot: great; though, I found myself wishing the story involved more of the outside world. *SPOILER ALERT*: At the end of the book the main character, Parzival, is given the opportunity to literally destroy the entire game. I think this decision loses it's punch since we know next to nothing about the outside world.
World-building: sub-par, the world inside the game itself is fascinating. The world-building is mostly narrative exposition. I found myself distracted by it. Rather than explaining the rules of the game through the unfolding of events much of the book is spent in exposition explaining the rules of the game. Since it's a book about a video game it almost works. It reads like you telling your friends about a game you played, and in that way you never feel fully immersed in it.

Really the lack of story about the outside world is what this book is missing...
