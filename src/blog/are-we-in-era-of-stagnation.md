Great ideas from [podcast notes](https://podcastnotes.org/2019/07/17/thiel/)

Interesting ideas from a new podcast, [The Portal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9f0W2KD5s) I hadn't heard before:

### We are in an era of economic stagnation.
  - definitely I've heard this one, but there are more facts and figures to look up:
  
### an era of technological stagnation
> Go into a room and subtract off all the screens. How do you know you are not in 1973 but for design? There aren't that many clues.
- The idea that we are in an era of a `dizzying sense of change` is unfounded.

### an era of institutional / educational stagnation
  - Student loans are an issue. With the magnitude of loans you are forced to take less risk.
  - There was a new student loan policy that made student loans unforgiveable. At age 65 Social Security will garnish your wages to pay off your loans
    - this also may have given Educational Institutions further leeway / incentive to raise tuitions
    
  - Institutions push back against change. 
  - University presidents are no longer great thinkers. They are simply great administrators.
