As an aside [here is a great paper with methodology explaining predictions from IHME at the University of Washington](http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/forecasting-covid-19-impact-hospital-bed-days-icu-days-ventilator-days-and-deaths). IHME projects about 50,000 deaths by the end of April.
