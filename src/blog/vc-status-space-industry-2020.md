The space industry in particular has many companies that earn zero revenue and our still in R&D phase, making them less valuable to invest in during the coronavirus crisis:

> [Rocket Lab's CEO, Peter Beck,] said VCs are not looking to invest in any companies that are “pre-revenue” for at least a year. After talking to Rocket Lab’s investors, the general consensus for Beck was that it will take VC firms “a very, very long time to return to the space industry.” For context, the first quarter of 2020 alone saw $5.4 billion of equity investment in U.S. space companies.
