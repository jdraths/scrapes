Compared to plant-based meats cultured meat is biologically very similar to traditional meat resulting in a similar sensory profile, making cultured meat more acceptable to the average consumer.

Compared to traditional meat the cost inputs for cultured meat are far less. Less land, less water, less plant-feed. More efficient.

There have also been investments in cultured seafood, leather, silk, egg white, milk, gelatin, and horn.

## Future Meat

> Future Meat is far from the only company that has set out to create affordable cell-cultured meat. Several dozen start-ups, mostly in the U.S. and Europe, have sprung up in the last couple of years to develop the product.

> But only one, Memphis Meats, has raised more money than Future Meat in a Series A funding round — $17 million in 2017 — thanks to investments from Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Cargill.
