Compared to plant-based meats cultured meat is biologically very similar to traditional meat resulting in a similar sensory profile, making cultured meat more acceptable to the average consumer.

Compared to traditional meat the cost inputs for cultured meat are far less. Less land, less water, less plant-feed. More efficient.

There have also been investments in cultured seafood, leather, silk, egg white, milk, gelatin, and horn.

## Future Meat

[Future Meat raises $14M Series A](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/10/future-meat-technologies-a-lab-grown-meat-start-up-raises-14-million-dollars.html)

> Future Meat is far from the only company that has set out to create affordable cell-cultured meat. Several dozen start-ups, mostly in the U.S. and Europe, have sprung up in the last couple of years to develop the product.
>
> But only one, Memphis Meats, has raised more money than Future Meat in a Series A funding round — $17 million in 2017 — thanks to investments from Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Cargill.

Investors:

> S2G Ventures, a Chicago-based venture capital fund that invests in food and agriculture, and Emerald Technology Ventures, a Swiss-based firm, led the $14 million round, Future Meat announced Thursday.

## Memphis Meats

> Memphis Meats expects to use the funds to build a pilot production facility, continue to grow its world-class team, and to hit a major milestone of launching products into the market. The company has not yet announced a date for product launch and is working with regulatory agencies to ensure a timely and safe market entry. 

Investors:

>The Series B round is led by SoftBank Group, Norwest and Temasek. Also joining the round are new and existing investors including Bill Gates, Richard Branson, Threshold Ventures, Cargill, Tyson Foods, Kimbal Musk, Fifty Years and CPT Capital. This round extends the Memphis Meats coalition to Asia, which is a strategically valuable market for cell-based meat and faces significant challenges in meeting growing demand for meat.
