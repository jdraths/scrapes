Compared to plant-based meats cultured meat is biologically very similar to traditional meat resulting in a similar sensory profile, making cultured meat more acceptable to the average consumer.

Compared to traditional meat the cost inputs for cultured meat are far less. Less land, less water, less plant-feed. More efficient.

There have also been investments in cultured seafood, leather, silk, egg white, milk, gelatin, and horn.
